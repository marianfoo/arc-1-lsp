# CLAUDE.md — arc-1-lsp

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. Read first.

## What this is

`arc-1-lsp` is an ARC-1 edition that **delegates all ABAP/ADT work to SAP's
embedded `adt-ls`** (headless Eclipse LS from `sapse.adt-vscode`). It is the
single-developer / desktop sibling to the main multi-user/BTP ARC-1. The main
ARC-1 lives at `../arc-1`; deep background on the design and the `adt-ls`
internals is in `../arc-1/docs/research/{arc1-embedded-adt-ls-edition,sapse-adt-vscode-mcp}.md`.

## Read these first (decisions, assumptions, history)

Much of this design is shaped by *current* adt-ls limitations that SAP may lift —
so understand the **why** before changing anything:
- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records (the decisions + "revisit when").
  Start at `docs/adr/README.md`.
- **`docs/assumptions-and-future-changes.md`** — the watch-list: auth, PP, BTP
  setup, licensing, the private LSP protocol, TLS — what to re-verify against the
  installed adt-ls version, and what would let us delete complexity.
- **`docs/journey.md`** — the chronological story incl. dead-ends (don't re-walk them).
- **`docs/adt-ls-headless-notes.md`** — the reverse-engineered headless **connection**
  recipe (initialize/userAgentInfos, reentrance-ticket logon, HTTPS requirement).
- **`docs/adt-ls-reference.md`** — ⭐ THE authoritative, live-verified **capability
  map**: the URI model + the `getLsUri` name→URI resolver, the full method/tool
  matrix, the object-type support boundary (modern ABAP-Cloud types served; classic
  → "use Eclipse"), the proven create→edit→activate→test→delete lifecycle, and
  gotchas. **Read this before adding any adt-ls-backed tool**, and **record new adt-ls
  findings here** (exact call + observed result). `adt-ls-tool-surface.md` is a stub → this.
- **`docs/arc-1-feature-parity.md`** — arc-1 vs arc-1-lsp coverage + per-capability
  "implemented? why/why-not". Read before adding tools, to know what's in scope.
- **`docs/plans/`** — ralphex plans (completed + in-progress) per roadmap state.

**Documentation convention for adt-ls findings:** whenever a spike/test reveals how
an adt-ls call behaves (params, URI shape, what works/fails headless), update
`docs/adt-ls-reference.md` with the exact call + observed result/error as evidence.
That doc is the durable memory — keep it correct over clever. Decisions → an ADR;
the arc-1 comparison → feature-parity; the connection recipe → headless-notes.

## Design principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Zero hand-rolled ADT — HARD LINE, no hybrid.** Never port `src/adt/{http,crud,
   xml-parser,…}` from ARC-1, and **never make direct HTTP ADT calls** (no
   `GET /sap/bc/adt/…`) — even when it's trivially easy and the adt-ls path is flaky
   or missing. CSRF, locking, XML, activation, transport all live in `adt-ls`.
   **adt-ls's headless capability IS arc-1-lsp's product boundary** — what it can't
   reach is out of scope here and belongs to main ARC-1. The reverse proxy/bridge
   carry adt-ls's *own* traffic only. See ADR-0003 + `docs/arc-1-feature-parity.md`.
2. **BYO `adt-ls`.** Never bundle/commit the binary (SAP Developer License).
   Discover a developer-provided one (`src/adt-ls/discovery.ts`).
3. **Reuse ARC-1's shell.** MCP server, auth (API key first, XSUAA later), scope
   policy, audit, stderr logging, Zod schemas — adapt, don't reinvent.
4. **Two channels to `adt-ls`.** MCP federation (stable, primary for tools) +
   LSP (rich language intelligence, later). Foundation uses LSP only to
   bootstrap + start the MCP server.
5. **stdout is sacred.** Logging → stderr only (`src/server/logger.ts`). ESM-only,
   `.js` import extensions, TS strict, Biome (2-space/single-quote/120).

## SAP connection (headless, ADR-0005/0006)

To reach a SAP backend, the engine (`planConnection` + `connect` in `engine.ts`):
1. builds TLS material from adt-ls's **own JRE** (`cert.ts`: copy cacerts + add a
   `CN=localhost` cert → truststore via `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`),
2. starts the **TLS reverse proxy** (`tls-reverse-proxy.ts`) — adt-ls connects to
   `https://localhost:<port>` (trusted, hostname-matched) and it re-originates to
   the backend: **DIRECT** (internet-reachable) or **CC** (→ `bridge.ts` → BTP
   Connectivity → Cloud Connector),
3. creates a `reentranceTicket` destination + **headless reentrance logon**
   (`destinations.ts`): GET logonUrl with real creds → 307 ticket → fire-and-forget
   deliver to adt-ls's `/adt/redirect` → return `true` immediately.

`planConnection`: on BTP (connectivity bound) `ARC1_SAP_DESTINATION` → CC mode
(resolve the BTP destination); else full `ARC1_SAP_*` → DIRECT; else none.
Connection failure is **non-fatal** (server starts disconnected). Three load-bearing
facts, all live-verified: `authenticationKind:reentranceTicket` (NOT basicAuth),
`protocol:"http"` + HTTPS systemUrl, fire-and-forget delivery. Full recipe +
dead-ends: `docs/adt-ls-headless-notes.md`. `openssl` (cert gen) + `keytool` (in
adt-ls's JRE) are runtime deps — `openssl` is in the Dockerfile.

## Key facts about `adt-ls`

- Launch: `adt-ls -Djco.trace_path <dir> -data <dir> --pipe=<unix-socket>`
  (client listens on the pipe, LS connects). serverInfo `ADTLS 1.0.0.<build>`.
- Custom LSP namespace `adtLs/*`: `mcp/{startMCPServer,stopMCPServer,setDestination}`,
  `destinations/{create,ensureLoggedOn,list,…}`, `fileSystem/{readFile,writeFile,
  lockFile,unlockFile,…}`, `activation/activate`, `cts/transport/*`,
  `abapUnit/runTests`, `atc/runCheck`, `businessservice/srvb/*` — full map in
  the ARC-1 research doc.
- Auth kinds it supports: `BASIC_AUTH`, `OAUTH` (Bearer/PKCE), `SSO`,
  `SAML_WITH_REENTRANCE_TICKET`. The VS Code UI only exposes SSO/reentrance;
  basic auth is configurable in `destinations.json` (used for the fixed-user
  deploy and the per-user PP proxy).
- **SAP session expires on inactivity** → every call then fails "Your user was
  logged off" until re-logon. There is no `logoff` method; `ensureLoggedOn`
  re-fires the registered reentrance handler and heals it. arc-1-lsp does this
  automatically (`session-retry.ts`, `engine.reconnect()`) — detect, re-logon,
  retry once. Full evidence: `docs/adt-ls-reference.md` §7.

## Workflow (the loop)

Per roadmap state: create a ralphex plan in `docs/plans/` (`.claude/commands/
ralphex-plan.md`), self-review, implement, test, review, advance. Every
code-changing task includes tests. adt-ls-dependent tests must `skipIf` when no
binary is present so CI stays green.

## Build & test

```bash
npm run build       # tsc → dist/
npm test            # vitest (smoke tests run for real when adt-ls is present)
npm run typecheck
npm run lint        # biome
```
