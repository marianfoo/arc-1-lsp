/**
 * Self-healing SAP session: detect adt-ls "logged off" failures and transparently
 * re-logon + retry once.
 *
 * Why this exists: adt-ls holds a SAP *security session* for the destination
 * after the reentrance-ticket logon. That session expires server-side (typically
 * on inactivity). When it does, the next ADT call fails with "Your user was
 * logged off" — and stays broken until the destination logs on again. Before this
 * module the only cure was restarting the whole instance (observed on CF).
 *
 * The cure is cheap: call `ensureLoggedOn` again. Our reentrance-ticket handler
 * stays registered on the driver for the process lifetime, so a fresh
 * `ensureLoggedOn` re-fires it and re-establishes the session via the exact path
 * proven at startup (ADR-0006). This module is the pure policy — detection +
 * single-retry orchestration + re-logon de-duplication — wired to the real
 * `ensureLoggedOn`/`setMcpDestination` in `engine.ts`.
 */

/**
 * Signatures of a lost SAP session. Deliberately specific (SAP's "logged off"
 * phrase, session-expiry variants, explicit HTTP 401) rather than broad — a false
 * positive would re-logon + retry a call that failed for an unrelated reason. A
 * normal ABAP syntax/validation error never matches.

 * on (the caller should then retry its original op); `false` when the session was
 * already alive (the empty/error was genuine, e.g. a real "not found"). Used both
