/**
 * Best-effort retry for adt-ls's COLD-BACKEND window. The first repository/CTS
 * calls after a fresh connection (or after the backend session sits idle) come
 * back EITHER empty (a search that should have hits returns []) OR throw a generic
 * "Internal error" — until the SAP-side caches warm up. Either mode would surface
 * to an agent as a spurious "not found" / failure on the very first call.
 *
 * `withColdRetry` retries a bounded number of times with linear backoff. The caller
 * decides what counts as a cold (retryable) outcome via `retryResult` (a result that
 * should be retried, e.g. empty references) and `retryError` (a thrown error that
 * should be retried, e.g. the transient "Internal error"). `sleep` is injectable so
 * tests run instantly. A genuinely-empty result / genuine error still surfaces once
 * the attempts are exhausted — the retry never hides a real outcome, only re-checks it.
 *
 * NOTE: the empty-result retry is deliberately kept ON for every cold call (not
 * disabled after a first success) because the backend can go cold AGAIN after idle —
 * a sticky "already warmed" flag would reintroduce the false-negative after an
 * inactivity gap, which is exactly the unattended-agent case this guards.
